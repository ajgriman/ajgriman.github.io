From Google's early days to the AI era. My story began when I received an exclusive Gmail invitation and dove into the fascinating world of P2P networks and digital exploration.

## Discovering Linux

My brother decided to open a cybercafé and I actively participated in installing computers, networks, and servers. That's where a technician told me about Linux: _"A Linux server can run for years without breaking down or slowing down."_ Those words sparked my curiosity and determination.

I chose Red Hat Linux as my first distribution, though SUSE always attracted me. I dove in completely: configuring servers, firewalls, gaming networks, and specialized applications. Over time, Linux became my main system, evolving toward Debian and its derivatives.

## Professional Evolution

Life led me toward hardware and business. I founded a company with my brother, specializing in refurbished systems with real warranties. The business thrived, but my passion for software took a backseat.

A personal crisis took me to Argentina, where everything changed. At a tech fair in Barracas, I met Sebastián, LATAM director of Le Wagon. That chance encounter redefined my professional career.

## The Transformation

Le Wagon's bootcamp was one of the most challenging experiences of my life. The content's intensity and the challenges' complexity pushed me to my limits, confronting me with impostor syndrome. But I persisted, practicing every exercise until I mastered it completely.

After years as a nomad traveling through South America, another crisis motivated me to rebuild myself through what I love most: technology, now powered by artificial intelligence.

## The Present

Today I return with renewed hunger for complex and sophisticated projects. My experience spans from Linux system administration to modern full-stack development, combining decades of technical experience with the latest innovations in AI.

If you're looking for a committed developer oriented toward excellence, with a solid technical foundation and passion for innovation, let's connect and build something extraordinary together.
