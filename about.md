**From Gmail's exclusivity to the AI revolution:**
I received an exclusive invitation for Gmail and dove headfirst into the digital realm. Back then, my brother opened an internet café, and while setting up computers and networks, a technician casually remarked, "A Linux server can run for years without failing." That line hooked me. I started with Red Hat, dabbled with SUSE, and eventually fell for Debian.

Later, I co-founded a systems refurbishment company with my brother, but my passion for software paused until a crisis led me to Argentina. At a tech fair in Barracas, a chance meeting with Sebastián, LATAM director at Le Wagon, changed my path.

The Le Wagon bootcamp was a roller coaster: intense challenges, bouts of impostor syndrome, and relentless practice until I mastered every hurdle. After years as a nomad traversing South America, I'm back with an appetite for complex projects—melding decades of Linux experience, full-stack development, and the power of artificial intelligence.

If you're looking for a no-nonsense developer who mixes hard facts with a dash of humor, I'm here to build something extraordinary!
