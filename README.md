# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and enhanced with [Polyglot](https://github.com/untra/polyglot) for multilingual support. The site is designed to showcase projects, ideas, and experiments in a clean and responsive layout.

Feel free to explore, and if you'd like to collaborate or learn more, please get in touch.
