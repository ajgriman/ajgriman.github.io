Built a full-featured movie watchlist app enabling users to create/manage lists, bookmark films with personalized comments, and review collections. Key features include:  
- Dynamic Lists: CRUD operations with image URLs (validated) and responsive card displays  
- Smart Bookmarking: Tom Select-powered searchable dropdowns for movie selection with comment validation (6+ chars)  
- Review Ecosystem: Star-rating.js integration for 1-5 ratings + text reviews displayed via custom SVG helpers  

Mastered Rails 7's JavaScript integration hurdles:  
- Importmap Challenges: Diagnosed UMD/IIFE vs. ES module conflicts in AOS.js/Star-Rating.js  
- Vendor Solutions: Modified library source (e.g., `this`â†’`window` bindings) to enable local ES module loading  
- Turbo Optimization: Initialized libraries on `turbo:load` with timeout fallbacks for DOM stability  
- Testing Rigor: Configured RSpec submodule for model validations (uniqueness, FK constraints) and movie deletion guards  

Delivered polished UX through:  
- Animated UI: Typed.js titles + AOS.js scroll-triggered card reveals  
- Bootstrap 5 + Custom SCSS: Responsive banners with image fallbacks  
- Database Integrity: PostgreSQL-backed movie seeding with `dependent: :restrict_with_error` safeguards  
- Debugging Wins: Resolved asset pathing (SVGs), CSS conflicts, and initialization race conditions
