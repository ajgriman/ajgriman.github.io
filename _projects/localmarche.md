I engineered a Ruby script that transforms barcode-scanned data into Wix-compatible CSV formats, enabling granular weight-based product variations (e.g., 100g, 500g, 1kg versions of the same item). This automated workflow eliminated stock discrepancies while giving customers dynamic dropdown menus to select preferred packaging sizes.

To address Venezuela's dual-currency economy, I implemented JavaScript that fetches real-time USD/VES rates from exchangerate-api.com. Prices dynamically convert to Bolívares at point-of-view, with exchange rates updating daily. Mobile-first optimization ensured seamless shopping across devices, while Wix's native SEO tools boosted organic discoverability for local grocery searches.

Navigating Wix's closed ecosystem demanded creative problem-solving: customized scripts bypassed platform limitations in inventory management, though front-end modifications were restricted to Wix's modules. This project deepened my expertise in SaaS workarounds and hybrid solutions (external APIs + proprietary platforms).
