A Ruby script was developed to transform barcode scanner data into CSV formats compatible with Wix, enabling product variations by weight (e.g., 100g, 500g, 1kg versions of the same item). This automated workflow eliminated stock discrepancies and provided dropdown menus for selecting product presentations.

For the Venezuelan dual-currency economy, JavaScript was implemented to fetch real-time USD/VES rates from exchangerate-api.com. Prices are dynamically converted to Bolívares at the time of viewing, with daily updates. Mobile-first optimization ensured a smooth purchasing experience, while Wix's SEO tools improved visibility in local grocery searches.

Working within Wix's closed ecosystem required creative solutions: custom scripts overcame inventory management limitations, although front-end modifications were restricted to Wix modules. The project enhanced expertise in hybrid solutions (external APIs + proprietary platforms).
