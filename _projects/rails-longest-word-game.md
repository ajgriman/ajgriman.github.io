A word game was implemented in Ruby on Rails, where players attempt to create the longest possible word from a random selection of letters. The application checks word validity using a dictionary API and provides immediate feedback on the results.

The project utilizes Rails MVC architecture, integrates with external APIs, and employs Bootstrap for responsive design. The codebase is organized for maintainability and clarity, serving as a reference for similar educational or entertainment applications.

This project demonstrates best practices in Rails development and interactive web application design.
