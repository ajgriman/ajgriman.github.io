The objective? Create an engaging experience where players form words from randomized 10-letter sets, validating submissions against grid constraints and a live dictionary APIâ€”replacing manual verification with automated logic.  

I architected a RESTful flow: the `GamesController` serves `/new` with procedurally generated letter grids, while `/score` processes submissions through triple-layer validation (grid compliance, English verification via API, scoring).

Key innovations included Rails sessions for persistent score tracking without databases and Bootstrap integration for responsive card-based UI.
