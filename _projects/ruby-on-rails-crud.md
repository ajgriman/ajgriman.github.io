I built a simple restaurant management system in Rails with full CRUD functionality. 

The application handles all basic operations (create, view, edit, delete restaurants) with validations requiring name, address, and a 0-5 rating, while providing user feedback through success/error messages. 

Technically, I implemented RESTful routes following MVC pattern, shared form logic between views, and used controller optimizations like before_action for cleaner code. The project included comprehensive testing of model validations and all CRUD flows, helping me practice core Rails patterns, improve testing skills, and apply DRY principles - all as part of strengthening my Rails fundamentals through this educational exercise.
