A CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application was implemented using Ruby on Rails to demonstrate fundamental web development concepts. The project features a simple interface for managing records, with validations to ensure data integrity and RESTful routing for maintainability.

The application structure follows Rails conventions, utilizing MVC architecture to separate concerns. Bootstrap was integrated for responsive design, and SQLite was used as the database for ease of setup and testing. The codebase serves as a reference for best practices in Rails development, including the use of partials, helpers, and strong parameters.

This project is suitable for educational purposes and as a starting point for more complex Rails applications.
