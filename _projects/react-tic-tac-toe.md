This Tic Tac Toe game is an interactive exploration of React’s core functionalities. It uses functional components, hooks for state management, and conditional rendering to create a simple yet engaging experience.

The structure of the project highlights key practices—modularity with component reusability, effective state tracking, and a clear separation of concerns. Version control via Git and deployment on GitHub Pages further underscore contemporary web development techniques.

Dedicated to my beloved son, this project celebrates the art of thoughtful design and playful interaction. It invites viewers to appreciate the clean, dynamic implementation of timeless game logic.
