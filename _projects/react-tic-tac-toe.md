A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game was implemented using React to demonstrate component-based architecture and state management. The application allows two players to compete, with logic to detect wins and draws.

The project features a responsive layout for optimal play on various devices. The codebase is organized for readability and maintainability, making it suitable for learning or as a foundation for more complex React projects.

This implementation highlights best practices in React development, including the use of functional components and modular styling.
